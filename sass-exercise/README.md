# SASS Exercise - Webpage: Inflora

### This repository was created to let you exercise some SASS, using nested styling, mixins and variables.

## Main Goal

The JavaScript code for the wonderful Webpage "Inflora" has been provided. The only thing you have to do is: Make it pretty by using SASS!
Here are Screenshots of a finalized responsive Version.
One of the main style functionalities is a switch between a dark and a light theme.
As mentioned already, the JS functionality for that is already given!

Here is a possible Desktop View:
<img src="images/Desktop-Light.png" alt="Desktop Light Version" width="50"/>
<img src="images/Desktop-Dark.png" alt="Desktop Dark Version" width="50"/>

<img src="images/Mobile-Light.png" alt="Mobile Light Version" width="50"/>
<img src="images/Mobile-Dark.png" alt="Mobile Dark Version" width="50"/>

The colors are given as variables as well, however: Feel free to colors the style the way you want it!

## Requirements

1. Make a responsive Webpage (different on desktop and mobile)
2. Use mixins! (An example is given within the code)
3. Use variables! (Examples are given within the code)
4. Colors change by toggling the theme button
5. Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
