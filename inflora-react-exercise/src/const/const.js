export const infoText1 = `To most humans, flowers are seen as objects to decorate homes, 
  gardens, bodies, and more. However, flowers have a much more important purpose than 
  decorating. Flowers are the part of plants that make seeds which in turn make new 
  plants. In order to make a seed, pollen from one flower has to combine with the eggs 
  from another flower; this is called pollination. Flowers are highly adapted to attract 
  their specific pollinators such as bees, flies, moths, hummingbirds, and bats just to 
  name a few. This is why flowers are brightly colored and highly scented making them 
  the beautiful creations that they are. The facts about flowers are that without them, 
  we would not have food, medicines, dyes, textiles, and other necessities of daily living. 
  There are so many interesting facts about flowers!`;

export const infoText2 = `Plants can photosynthesize due to cells called 
  chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll; this is what makes plants green. 
  Sun strikes the chloroplasts and combines with carbon dioxide that plants get 
  from their leaves, and water that plants get through their roots, to produce 
  sugar, or glucose. This is the plant's food, and this gives the plant energy 
  to grow and produce flowers.`;

export const infoText3 = `Pollinators like bees, animals, and birds come and gather pollen 
  from the flowers. The pollen sticks to their bodies. When they go to visit another 
  flower to gather more pollen, the pollen from the previous flower drops into the 
  pistil of the new flower, fertilizes the eggs inside the ovary, and seeds are made.`;
